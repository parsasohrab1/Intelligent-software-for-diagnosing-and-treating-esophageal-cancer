  "summary": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting ZC3H18 were purchased from Suzhou Hongxun Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Suzhou, China), with an empty vector serving as the control (si-nc). ZC3H18 siRNA sequences were GGGGTGAGGGCTTCTGATCT and TCGTCGGAGTGATTATCTTCCT. These siRNAs were introduced into KYSE150 and ECA109 cells using DharmaFect1 (Suzhou Hongxun Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China).",
