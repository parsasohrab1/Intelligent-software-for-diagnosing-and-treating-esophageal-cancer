  "title": "lncRNAs and mRNAs expression data in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(ESCC) and adjacent normal tissues",
  "summary": "The differential expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in high-incidence areas of China was constructed and co-expression correlation analysis was performed. The expression profile of lncRNAs in ESCC tissues was significantly different from that in adjacent normal tissues. Co-expression analysis revealed that lncRNA may be involved in the occurrence and development of esophageal cancer, thus providing a new basis for the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal cancer.",
