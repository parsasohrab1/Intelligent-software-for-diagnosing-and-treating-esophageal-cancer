  "title": "Tumor fibroblast-derived FGF2 regulates SPRY1 expression in esophageal tumor-infiltrating T cells and plays a role in T cell exhaustion",
  "summary": "Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that exhausted T cells in esophageal cancer were more heterogeneous than previously clarified. We discovered that SPRY1 was notably enriched in two subsets of exhausted CD8+ T cells. When overexpressed, SPRY1 impaired T cell activation by interacting with CBL, which is a negative regulator of ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation.",
