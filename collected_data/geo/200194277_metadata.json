  "title": "Modulation of the tumor promoting functions of cancer associated fibroblasts by phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibition increases the efficacy of chemotherapy in human preclinical models of esophageal adenocarcinoma",
  "summary": "The chemotherapy resistance of esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC) is underpinned by cancer cell extrinsic mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment (TME). We demonstrate that by targeting the tumor-promoting functions of the predominant TME cell type, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) we can enhance the efficacy of standard-of-care chemotherapy. These findings demonstrate that CAF drive chemotherapy resistance in EAC and can be targeted by repurposing PDE5i, a safe and well tolerated class of drug administered to millions of patients world-wide to treat erectile dysfunction.",
