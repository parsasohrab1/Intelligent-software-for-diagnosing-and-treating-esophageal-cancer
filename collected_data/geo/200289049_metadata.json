  "summary": "Cancer cell lineage plasticity complicates tumor initiation and progression. Using genetic barcoding and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we mapped esophageal preneoplastic cell lineages and developed the eXamined Ridge (XR) score to identify high-plasticity cells. We discovered preneoplastic precursor cells (PNPCs) as key progenitors and identified Nfib and Qk as conserved markers, highlighting potential biomarkers for early cancer detection and intervention.",
