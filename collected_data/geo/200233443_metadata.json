  "title": "Eosinophils exert direct and indirect anti-tumorigenic effects in the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [4NQOinDBLgata]",
  "summary": "Eosinophils are present in several solid tumors and have context-dependent function. The role of eosinophils in the development of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC), 85% of esophageal cancers worldwide, is unknown. Mice were treated with 4-nitroquinolone-1-oxide (4-NQO) for 8 weeks followed by vehicle for 8 weeks to induce esophageal squamous pre-cancer. Eosinophil depletion using three mouse models resulted in exacerbated 4-NQO tumorigenesis.  RNA-sequencing on the whole esophagus of WT and ?dblGATA mice was done in the pre-cancer model to understand how the presence of eosinophils affects the pre-cancer esophageal environment.",
