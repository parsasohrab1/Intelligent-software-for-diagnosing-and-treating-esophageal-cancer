  "title": "RNA-seq data of esophageal cancer cell Kyse510 after inhibition or silencing of LSD1 and G9a",
  "summary": "The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling (mRNA level) and signaling pathways between the control and ablating LSD1, the control and ablating G9a, the control and co-ablating LSD1 and G9a. We found pathways in apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response were obviously changed in these groups, which are important for esophageal cancer therapy.",
